    <para>
      Items in the canvas typically have a number of properties specifying
      their location and size. For example the #GooCanvasRect item has
      #GooCanvasRect:x, #GooCanvasRect:y, #GooCanvasRect:width and
      #GooCanvasRect:height properties.
    </para>
    <para>
      However, items can also have a transformation matrix (e.g. the
      #GooCanvasItem:transform property).
      Transformation matrices modify the item's coordinate space in some
      way. Modifications include translation (moving the origin), rotation,
      scaling, and skewing, or combinations of these. Thus the final
      position of the item on the canvas can be altered dramatically.
    </para>
    <para>
      The simple animation features in #GooCanvas are accomplished by
      modifying the item's transformation matrix over time.
      (See goo_canvas_item_animate().)
    </para>
    <para>
      Since items are in a hierarchy it is possible to move or rotate an
      entire group of items by simply changing the transformation matrix
      of the group containing them.
    </para>
    <para>
      The coordinate space used within the item itself (e.g. where the
      #GooCanvasRect:x and #GooCanvasRect:y properties of a #GooCanvasRect
      are specified)
      is referred to as "Item Space". The coordinate space used by
      the entire canvas is referred to as "Device Space". "Item Space"
      and "Device Space" may or may not be the same, depending on whether
      the item or any of its ancestors have a transformation matrix set.
      (Note that the entire canvas may also be scrolled and/or zoomed,
      which means that there may be additional transformations above
      "Device Space".)
    </para>
    <para>
      Functions are provided to convert between coordinate spaces,
      e.g. goo_canvas_convert_to_item_space() and
      goo_canvas_convert_from_item_space() convert device space coordinates
      to item space and vice versa.
